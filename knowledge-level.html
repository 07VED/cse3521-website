For those new to the field of AI, the terminology may be somewhat
abstract. We talk about "<b>goals</b>," "<b>actions</b>," "<b>perceptions</b>," and
"<b>knowledge</b>." But what are these concepts? How do they relate to more familiar terms?
</p>

<p>
New terminology is often a feature of a field of study; perhaps,
terminology is partly what defines a field of study as separate from
others. But the terminology is not just a way for a field to
differentiate itself. The terminology is necessary to properly
understand what is being investigated and explained.
</p>

<p>
In the philosophy of science, there is much interest in figuring out
what constitutes an <i>explanation</i>. What is generally agreed upon is
that an explanation should tell a "causal story" by including
specifics about how events effect others. This causal
story should enable one to imagine how different configurations
could cause different outcomes (i.e., the causal story should support
a mental model). An explanation also should be non-obvious and hide
irrelevant details. In short, an explanation should be at a certain
"level" of description; not too high-level as to be completely vague,
and not too low-level as to make the mental model or causal story
so complex that alternative outcomes cannot be easily imagined.
</p>

<p>
Imagine trying to explain the role of a four-chambered heart while
being restricted only to the concepts and terminology of molecular
chemistry. The role of the heart, what it does for the animal, cannot
possibly be described with such terminology. Molecular chemistry plays a role in every organ, every cell, of the animal, so the language of chemistry is not capable of explaining why a heart is special.
</p>

<p>
Now, imagine trying to describe how a computer program sorts a list of numbers by using only concepts and terminology about logic gates,
resistors, capacitors, etc. While it could be done, the explanation of
the sorting procedure would be extraordinarily complex and, frankly,
completely non-explanatory. We could not answer the question, if this logic gate was instead wired to that logic gate, how would the sorting algorithm change? No one is capable of holding a mental model with such complexity.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, <b>imagine trying to explain Freud's Oedipus complex (boy loves his mother, wants to kill his father) in terms of neurons, dopamine, synaptic plasticity, &#x2026;</b>
</p>

<p>
Explanations that are too "high level" are also worthless. We will not
understanding the human heart, how it works and why we each have one,
if we speak at the level of societies and nation-states (whose
constituents all have hearts). Again, there is no causal story, so there is no explanation.
</p>

<p>
The point is that <b>there are more-or-less natural and obvious levels of
explanation</b>. The heart is best explained in terms of its role in
blood circulation and the body's need for oxygen (simplifying a bit). A sorting algorithm is best explained in terms of programming language constructs
(such as lists, loops, comparison operators, etc.). And the Oedipus complex
is best explained in terms of the id/ego/superego, castration anxiety, and so on.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">A hierarchy of levels</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
These levels of explanation form hierarchies. Here is a basic hierarchy for
computer systems and food:
</p>

<div class="center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/first-two-levels.png" alt="first-two-levels.png" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
A higher-level layer is an <b>specialization</b> of its next-lower layer. In these examples, a particular set of programming language instructions specialize the electronic circuitry; the instructions make a particular use of the circuits. Similarly, various foodstuffs combine basic molecules in particular ways.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, each lower-level layer is an <b>implementation</b> of the next-higher layer. Foodstuffs are "implemented" in physical form with glucose, dextrose, etc. And computer software is implemented in electrical circuits. Perhaps there are different possible implementations. Software, at least, could be "executed" by hand (pencil &amp; paper). In the past, programmers executed their code by hand, when computers were not available for every person all the time.
</p>

<p>
Finally, <b>each level can be defined independently of its higher and lower
levels</b>. We can define exactly what transistors are; it does
not matter how they will be used (maybe to build a familiar computer, maybe
not), nor does it matter how they are implemented. Programmers generally never concern themselves with transistors and capacitors. A programmer can think about a problem in terms of data structures and algorithms and get along just fine.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">A new level</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
When we design and build AI systems, we find that <b>explanations stuck
at the symbol and algorithm level are too verbose</b>. For many larger software systems, it makes no difference how it is coded nor in what language. This is especially true for AI systems. There is something else about them. They
require a higher level of description than descriptions like "this is how we
sort a list of numbers." Why sort the numbers? What do the numbers represent?
</p>

<p>
In AI, we find it more useful to talk about "<b>goals</b>," "<b>actions</b>," "<b>perceptions</b>," and
"<b>knowledge</b>." A goal is something the system (the agent) wants to
accomplish. A perception is information the agent obtains about its environment. An action is something the agent can do in order to
change its environment. And knowledge is consulted in order to
choose the right actions, based on perceptions, in order to achieve
goals.
</p>

<p>
Exactly how goals, actions, perceptions, and knowledge are implemented
(realized in code) is not important if we are only describing what the
goals, actions, perceptions, and knowledge <i>are</i>. Their descriptions,
their explanations, exist in a level above the symbol and algorithm
level. Allen Newell calls this level the "<b>Knowledge level</b>." Perhaps we can define a similar level in the food domain, which I call the "diner" level, i.e., the level of description that restaurant patrons care about.
</p>

<div class="center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/knowledge-level.png" alt="knowledge-level.png" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
We can explain how AI systems work using only the terminology from the
knowledge level. This is what gives AI its own set of terminology, and
partly what makes AI a separate field of study (separate from software
engineering and electrical engineering, for example).
