The machine represents the paradoxes of our very existence as
thinking, rational, civilized beings capable of expression. On the one
hand, it is a sign of determinism, of the sheer predictability of
mechanism, including the mechanism of the models we employ to describe
our world and selves that we have grown from empirical evidence. On
the other hand it is an expression of our inventiveness and
freedom. --- David Porush, /The Soft Machine: Cybernetic Fiction/
