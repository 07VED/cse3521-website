* Day 1

** What is AI?

- [act/think] [rationally/humanly]

  - act rationally: do the correct things in
    the world

  - act humanly: do the things the human would
    do in the world

  - think rationally: use the best algorithms
    to get the correct results

  - think humanly: the AI system has internal
    representations and algorithms like human
    cognition

** Examples of AI

- system that designs video games
- IBM's Watson: won Jeopardy!, healthcare
- Siri
- IBM Deep Blue, beat Kasparov 1997, "Game Over",
  used specialized chips that play chess
- Google's autonomous vehicles
- Google bought Boston Dynamics
- Amazon Air (drones)
- Video game AI
- robots that learn new languages like toddlers do
- drone fighting drones
- military drones
- Google Glass
- Google Search
- Google Ads
- Google Now
- Google Then
- Google Future
- Machine Learning, Data Mining
- Fraud detection


* How do we test for AI?

- put it in a human situation and see if it comes to the same
  decisions as a human
  - maybe just report its decisions, not act on them
  - maybe also physically does the same things (if it has arms
    and legs, etc.)
- give it human tests for intelligence, IQ tests, SATs, LSAT,
  behavioral tests
- Voigt-Kampff test
- Turing Test
- interact with people who don't know it's a robot
- mock tests of certain scenarios
- see if you can tell the difference between human and machine
- human-robot chat
- see if it has self-preservation tendencies
- ask how it feels, emotions
- listen to a song with it, then ask it how the song makes it feel
- put it in a paradoxical situation, ethical conundrum
  - save your dog or the child
- ask any question about any topic to see how it responds
- job interview
- meet the president, or the Queen


* The Turing Test

** The imitation game

- A man (A), a woman (B), and a judge (C)
- The judge cannot see A or B (or hear them)
- The judge must determine who is the woman
- The man (A) wants to convince the judge that he is a woman
  - AND, (harder) that the woman is NOT a woman
- And the woman (B) is trying to convince the judge that she is
  the woman
- If the man succeeds, then we can say he is intelligent

** Replace the man with a machine

- now the machine (A) is trying to convince the judge that it
  is the woman
  - woman still trying to say she is the woman

- we often think of it as the machine trying to convince the judge
  that it is the human

** What's "success"?

- How often (%) must the man convince the judge that he is the
  woman to be considered a good woman imitator?
  - about 25%
  - Turing said 30% would be good enough


* Dennett's weaker versions

- Chess (beating Kasparov)
  - doesn't cover range of intelligence
  - isolatable skill
- Solves the Arab-Israeli conflict
  - harder than the TT
  - unrepeatable
  - slow
  - not clear what is considered winning
- Steals the crown jewels
  - might be able to find security vulnerabilities
  - luck
  - ethically dubious

** Langley's challenges

- Synthetic entertainer
  - American AIdoll
- Synthetic attorney
- Synthetic politician
